### Overview

This is the seventh project in Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Program. In this project I was tasked with building a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood of my choice. This project was built using create-react-app. The map is being provided by Google Maps API. The information describing the markers when clicked on is provided by FourSquare API. 

### Run

In this project folder, install project dependecis with `npm install` in your terminal window. 
 
Once you have that installed, run `npm start` in your terminal window. 

The site should pop up in your browser window however you can visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web window.
