# Feed Reader Testing (jasmine)

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The creator of this project clearly saw the value in testing that they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite to give students a head start. 

## Run

Clone the repo to your computer 
 ```git clone [name of repo]```

Open the `index.html` file in your browser. At the top of your screen you will see the 
feed reader application. At the bottom of the screen you will see the tests that I created, to test the functionality of the application.
