### Overview

This is the fifth project in Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Program. In this project I was given a static web page and tasked with making it responive and making it offline ready. 

### Run

In this project folder, start up your HTTP server to serve the site files on your local computer. 

Make sure you have Python installed on you machine by running `python -V`. 

Once you have that installed, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in your terminal window. 

Now visit this site by pasting `http://localhost:8000` in your web window.
