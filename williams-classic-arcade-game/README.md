###### Objective 
The objective of the game is to get the player from the grass to the water safely, meaning no bugs have *collided* with your player. If a bug collides with you player, your player will be sent back to thier 
starting position. If your player makes it to the water an alert will appear telling you so.

###### How to play 

Once the screen has loaded use the left, right, top, and bottom arrow keys to move your player to the water with out colliding with a bug.

Best of luck!
