### Overview

This is the sixth project in Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Program. In this project I was given a starter template and tasked to refactor it using React. 

### Run

In this project folder, install project dependecis with `npm install` in your terminal window. 
 
Once you have that installed, run `npm start` in your terminal window. 

The site should pop up in your browser window however you can visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web window.
